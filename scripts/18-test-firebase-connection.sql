-- Test Firebase Connection and Permissions
-- This script helps diagnose Firebase connectivity issues

-- Note: This is a placeholder for Firebase testing
-- Since we're using Firebase (not Supabase), we need to test via the application

-- For Firebase testing, please:
-- 1. Check if you're using emulators or production
-- 2. Verify your Firebase project configuration
-- 3. Test the connection through the application

-- If using Supabase instead of Firebase, run these queries:

-- Test basic connectivity
SELECT 'Firebase/Supabase Connection Test' as test_type;

-- Check if we can read from any table
SELECT 'Testing read permissions...' as status;

-- If you get permission errors, it means:
-- 1. Firebase rules are not deployed
-- 2. You're not authenticated
-- 3. You're using the wrong project
-- 4. Emulators are not running

-- For Firebase troubleshooting:
-- 1. Run: firebase login
-- 2. Run: firebase use your-project-id
-- 3. Run: firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
-- 4. Or run: ./start-firebase-emulators.sh (for local development)
