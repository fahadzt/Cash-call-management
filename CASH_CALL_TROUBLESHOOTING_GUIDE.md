# üîß Cash Call Creation Troubleshooting Guide

## üö® **The Problem**

You're creating a cash call in your affiliate account, but it doesn't appear in the dashboard. This means the cash call creation is failing silently or there's a filtering issue.

## üß™ **Step-by-Step Debugging**

### **Step 1: Use the Simple Test Page**

1. **Visit:** http://localhost:3001/simple-cash-call-test
2. **Login with your affiliate account**
3. **Check the user information** to verify:
   - Role is set to `affiliate`
   - Affiliate company ID is assigned
   - You can see available affiliates

### **Step 2: Check Browser Console**

Open your browser's developer tools (F12) and look for these debug messages:

```

User Email: ...
User Role: affiliate
Affiliate Company ID: ...

=== AFFILIATES ===
Total affiliates: X
- Company Name (CODE): ID

=== CASH CALLS ===
Total cash calls visible: X
```

### **Step 3: Test Cash Call Creation**

1. **Click "Create Test Cash Call"** button
2. **Watch the console** for these messages:
   ```
   === CREATING TEST CASH CALL ===
   Using affiliate: {id: "...", name: "...", ...}
   Creating cash call with data: {...}
   ‚úÖ Cash call created successfully with ID: ...
   === RELOADING DATA ===

   ```

   }
   ```

   }
   ```

## üöÄ **Quick Fixes**

{
  "role": "affiliate",
  "affiliate_company_id": "YOUR_AFFILIATE_ID"
}
```

### **If Affiliate Doesn't Exist:**

```javascript
// In Firebase Console, create affiliate document:
{
  "name": "Your Company",
  "company_code": "YOUR_CODE",
  "status": "active",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
}
```
